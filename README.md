# Project Title
SMS Spam Classifier using Machine Learning and Streamlit

🧠 Project Description
This project is a machine learning-based web application that classifies SMS text messages as either Spam or Not Spam. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with TF-IDF vectorization and a Naive Bayes classifier to make predictions.

It’s built with Python and deployed using Streamlit for a smooth and interactive user interface. The goal is to demonstrate how ML can be applied to real-world problems like filtering spam in communication systems.

🔍 How It Works
1 The user enters an SMS message in the app.

2 The message is preprocessed (lowercased, cleaned, stopwords removed).

3 The text is transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF.

4 A trained Naive Bayes model predicts the class.

5 The result (Spam or Not Spam) is shown immediately.
